# Text Summarization using Natural Language Processing

## Description

Text summarization is an invaluable tool in the realm of information extraction and comprehension. In a world inundated with vast amounts of textual data, the ability to condense and distill information into concise summaries has become crucial. Text summarization, as the name suggests, is the process of generating a condensed version of a given text while retaining its most important and relevant points.

In this project, we propose an extractive text summarization model based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The objective is to automatically identify and extract the most important sentences or phrases from a given document to create a coherent and concise summary.

## Working

## Run Locally

Clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MidanAhmed/NLP-text-summarization.git
```
Install all the Python modules and packages using `pip`.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the following command to start the server.
```
python app.py
```
Open [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in a web browser as flask uses 5000 as its default port number.

In this GUI, we can type a passage or upload an image which then returns us the summarized passage.
